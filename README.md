### Why we need such solution

About a third of the worldâ€™s population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Among communicable diseases, TB is the second leading cause of death worldwide after HIV/AIDS, killing nearly 2 million people each year. More than a half of TB cases occur in the largest Asian countries (India, China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Philippines, and Pakistan).

India accounts for one fourth of the global TB burden. In 2015, an estimated 28 lakh cases occurred and 4.8 lakh people died due to TB. India has highest burden of both TB and MDR TB based on estimates reported in Global TB Report 2016. About 85% of the all cases in India are of pulmonary tuberculosis.

### Our Solution
Our AI solution aims at helping people diagnosis their Tuberculosis faster than before so that they could get proper treatment at an early stage. We provide a deep learning based backend with an easy to use frontend(webapp) which can be used by hospitals/pathologies to diagnosis their patients. In backend we will be running a python script with our pretrained model that would return the probability whether a patient is suffering from the disease or not.

We have used fastai, an easy to use ML package based build over Pytorch, to train our model. We have used trained pretrained resnet34 model and got an accuracy close to 90 percent
